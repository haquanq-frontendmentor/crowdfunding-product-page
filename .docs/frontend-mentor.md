### What are you most proud of, and what would you do differently next time?

Hello 👋👋👋

Took me a while to complete this challenge! But completed it anyway! xD

🚀 **Built with**

- Mobile-first workflow
- ARIA specifications
- Semantic HTML
- Pure CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

🐲 **What i have done**

- Accessible forms, modals using aria patterns form ARIA APG page
- Used my own judgement to achieve **pixel-perfect** without design files
- Overridden default outline effect on focus (buttons, input, links)

🐦 **Things to improve**

- Next time i will try to find better focus-trap behavior on modals

### What challenges did you encounter, and how did you overcome them?

None 🐱

### What specific areas of your project would you like help with?

Anyone know how can I achieve bookmark current page on button click? Or is this possible nowadays? I found very little information about this. Thanks in advance 🙏
